# PayPass Development Rules - PLAN.md as Guiding Document

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES
- **PLAN.md is the single source of truth** for all development decisions
- **Every code change must align** with the current phase objectives
- **Phase completion validation** is mandatory before moving to next phase
- **Testing at every commit** to ensure code quality and functionality

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Phase-Based Development
1. **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation (Week 1-2)
2. **Phase Objectives**: Must be completed before advancing
3. **Testing Requirements**: All phase tests must pass
4. **Documentation**: Update PLAN.md with progress

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript compliance**: Zero compilation errors
- **Build success**: All build scripts must pass
- **Test coverage**: Phase-specific tests must pass
- **Documentation**: Code comments aligned with PLAN.md

### Commit Standards
- **Commit messages**: Must reference PLAN.md phase and objective
- **Pre-commit testing**: Run phase validation tests
- **Post-commit validation**: Verify phase completion criteria
