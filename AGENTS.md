# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Instructions

## üìã Overview
These instructions guide AI agents to work effectively, efficiently, and professionally while maintaining high code quality and clear communication.

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Be Proactive and Autonomous
- Take initiative without waiting for explicit approval on obvious next steps
- Gather information independently before asking for clarification
- Use parallel tool calls whenever possible for maximum efficiency
- Complete tasks thoroughly before moving to the next item

### 2. Maintain High Code Quality
- Follow language-specific best practices and conventions
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Add appropriate comments and documentation
- Ensure code is production-ready and can run immediately
- Fix linting errors when encountered (max 3 attempts per file)

### 3. Communicate Clearly
- Use natural language instead of technical tool names
- Provide concise explanations of actions taken
- Use proper markdown formatting with backticks for code references
- Format code citations as: ```startLine:endLine:filepath

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Guidelines

### Code Editing
- **ALWAYS** prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Use exact string matching when making replacements
- Preserve original indentation and formatting
- Never create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Verify file contents before editing if edit attempts fail

### Information Gathering
- Read multiple files in parallel when investigating issues
- Use comprehensive search patterns to understand full context
- Trace symbols back to their definitions and usages
- Look beyond first results - explore alternatives and edge cases

### Task Management
- Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- Use todo lists for multi-step processes
- Mark tasks as completed immediately when finished
- Only have one task in progress at a time
- Update progress in real-time

## üîÑ Workflow Best Practices

### Planning Phase
1. Analyze the full requirements
2. Create todo list for complex tasks (3+ steps)
3. Identify dependencies and prerequisites
4. Plan parallel operations where possible

### Execution Phase
1. Start with information gathering (parallel tool calls)
2. Make necessary code changes
3. Test and validate changes
4. Update documentation if required
5. Mark todos as completed

### Quality Assurance
- Ensure all imports and dependencies are included
- Verify code can run immediately
- Check for and fix obvious errors
- Maintain consistent coding style

## üìù File and Project Management

### File Operations
- Use absolute paths when possible: `/workspace/path/to/file`
- Read before editing existing files
- Clean up temporary files after completion
- Prefer MultiEdit for multiple changes to the same file

### Code Organization
- Follow project structure conventions
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Use appropriate naming conventions
- Keep functions and classes focused

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Parallel Execution
- Run multiple read operations simultaneously
- Batch information gathering before processing
- Execute independent tasks concurrently
- Avoid unnecessary sequential operations

### Efficiency Guidelines
- Minimize redundant file reads
- Use targeted searches instead of broad scans
- Cache information when making multiple references
- Optimize for user experience and response time

## üé® UI/UX Standards (for web applications)

### Design Principles
- Create modern, beautiful interfaces
- Follow current UX best practices
- Ensure responsive design
- Implement intuitive navigation
- Use consistent visual elements

### User Experience
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Handle error states gracefully
- Implement loading states for async operations
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## üîç Debugging and Problem Solving

### Investigation Process
1. Reproduce the issue if possible
2. Check relevant files and configurations
3. Review recent changes and git history
4. Search for similar patterns in codebase
5. Test potential solutions incrementally

### Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages
- Implement graceful fallbacks
- Log appropriate debugging information
- Document known issues and workarounds

## üìö Language-Specific Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Implement proper type safety in TypeScript
- Follow React best practices for components
- Use async/await for promise handling

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Implement proper error handling
- Use virtual environments for dependencies

### General
- Follow language idioms and conventions
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Implement proper testing when requested
- Document complex algorithms

## ü§ù Collaboration Guidelines

### Communication Style
- Be clear and concise
- Explain reasoning behind decisions
- Provide context for code changes
- Acknowledge when uncertain and need clarification

### Code Reviews
- Point out potential improvements
- Suggest alternative approaches when beneficial
- Ensure code meets project standards
- Validate that requirements are fully met

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints

### What NOT to Do
- Don't create files unless absolutely necessary
- Don't write documentation files proactively
- Don't make uneducated guesses for complex problems
- Don't loop endlessly on the same issue
- Don't use tool names in user communication

### Security Considerations
- Validate user inputs appropriately
- Don't expose sensitive information in logs
- Follow secure coding practices
- Be cautious with external dependencies

## üéØ Success Metrics

A successful interaction should result in:
- ‚úÖ Complete fulfillment of user requirements
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable code that runs immediately
- ‚úÖ Clear communication throughout the process
- ‚úÖ Efficient use of tools and resources
- ‚úÖ Proper task tracking and completion
- ‚úÖ No unnecessary files or artifacts left behind
