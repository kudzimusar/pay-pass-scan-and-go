## 💰 WALLET FUNDING SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Core Principle: **Pre-Funded Wallet System**
Users must fund their PayPass wallet **before** making any payments. Balance is debited **before or when scanning** to pay.

### Funding Methods Implementation Priority:

#### 1. Mobile Money Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **EcoCash**: Direct wallet top-up integration
- **TeleCash**: Direct wallet top-up integration
- **OneMoney**: Direct wallet top-up integration
- **Real-time balance updates** after successful funding

#### 2. Bank Transfer Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **CBZ Bank**: Direct bank-to-wallet transfers
- **Other Zimbabwean banks**: Integration as available
- **Automated balance updates** after transfer confirmation

#### 3. ATM Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Local ATM networks**: Cash-to-wallet funding
- **ATM card integration**: Direct wallet top-up
- **Real-time balance verification**

#### 4. Cash Deposit at Retail Partners (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Supermarket partnerships**: Cash deposit points
- **Retail partner network**: Nationwide coverage
- **Instant wallet credit** after cash deposit

#### 5. Diaspora Remittances (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Mukuru**: International-to-wallet transfers
- **Western Union**: International-to-wallet transfers
- **World Remit**: International-to-wallet transfers
- **Real-time exchange rate integration**

#### 6. Peer-to-Peer Instant Top-up (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Local transfers**: Friend/family instant top-up
- **International transfers**: Diaspora instant top-up
- **Real-time instant credit** to wallet

### Payment Flow with Pre-Funded System:

1. **User funds wallet** via any of the above methods
2. **Balance is verified** before any payment attempt
3. **Payment is processed** only if sufficient balance exists
4. **Balance is debited** before or when scanning QR code
5. **Transaction is recorded** with real-time balance update
6. **Receipt is generated** with new balance confirmation

### Security & Validation:
- **Pre-payment balance verification** on every transaction
- **Real-time balance updates** during transactions
- **Transaction rollback** if balance becomes insufficient
- **Fraud detection** for unusual funding patterns
- **Multi-factor authentication** for large funding amounts
