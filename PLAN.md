- **CBZ Bank**: Direct bank-to-wallet transfers
- **Other Zimbabwean banks**: Integration as available
- **Automated balance updates** after transfer confirmation

#### 3. ATM Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Local ATM networks**: Cash-to-wallet funding
- **ATM card integration**: Direct wallet top-up
- **Real-time balance verification**

#### 4. Cash Deposit at Retail Partners (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### Payment Flow with Pre-Funded System:

1. **User funds wallet** via any of the above methods
2. **Balance is verified** before any payment attempt
3. **Payment is processed** only if sufficient balance exists
4. **Balance is debited** before or when scanning QR code
5. **Transaction is recorded** with real-time balance update
6. **Receipt is generated** with new balance confirmation

### Security & Validation:
- **Pre-payment balance verification** on every transaction
- **Real-time balance updates** during transactions
- **Transaction rollback** if balance becomes insufficient
- **Fraud detection** for unusual funding patterns
- **Multi-factor authentication** for large funding amounts

## 🔒 SECURITY & USER PROTECTION ARCHITECTURE

### Core Security Principles:
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - **PIN**: Primary authentication method
   - **Biometric**: Fingerprint/face recognition for convenience
   - **OTP**: SMS or app-based for additional security
   - **Combination**: PIN + biometric + OTP for high-value transactions

2. **Public View Protection**
   - **No password entry in public view**
   - **Biometric authentication** for public spaces
   - **Tap-only actions** where possible
   - **Screen privacy protection**

3. **Account Recovery System**
   - **Phone recovery**: SMS verification
   - **Email recovery**: Email verification
   - **Social recovery**: Trusted contacts verification
   - **No risk of total loss** if phone is stolen

4. **Local Data Encryption**
   - **No critical data stored unencrypted locally**
   - **Encrypted local storage** for sensitive information
   - **Secure key management**
   - **Automatic data wiping** on security breach

### Security Implementation Priority:

#### 1. Multi-Factor Authentication (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **PIN System**: Enhanced PIN with complexity requirements
- **Biometric Integration**: Fingerprint and face recognition
- **OTP System**: SMS and app-based one-time passwords

- **Secure Key Management**: Proper key storage and rotation
- **Data Wiping**: Automatic data removal on security events
- **Memory Protection**: Secure memory handling

#### 4. Public View Protection (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Biometric Default**: Default to biometric in public
- **Screen Privacy**: Privacy screen protection
- **Tap-Only Actions**: Minimize typing in public
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout in public

#### 5. Fraud Detection (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time fraud detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Unusual activity detection
- **Geolocation Verification**: Location-based security
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Device-based security

### Security Flow Implementation:

1. **Login Process**:
   - User enters PIN (private space) or uses biometric (public space)
   - OTP sent for additional verification
   - Session established with encrypted tokens

2. **Transaction Security**:
