## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup database
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### 2. Development Workflow
```bash

## 🎯 Key Principles

### Development Philosophy
1. **USP-First Development** - "Pay for your Friend" functionality is our top priority
2. **Phase-Based Approach** - Complete each phase with 80%+ success rate before advancing
3. **Quality Gates** - No code progresses without passing validation
4. **Security by Design** - Security considerations built into every component
5. **Performance-First** - Optimize for mobile users and emerging markets

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Zero `any` types in production code
- **Test Coverage** - Minimum 80% overall, 95% for payment functionality
- **Security First** - All code reviewed for security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Budgets** - Strict performance targets for all user-facing features

### Architecture Principles
- **Microservices Ready** - Design for future microservices migration
- **Database Per Service** - Clear service boundaries with dedicated schemas
- **Event-Driven Communication** - Loose coupling between services
- **SAGA Pattern** - Distributed transaction management for cross-border payments
