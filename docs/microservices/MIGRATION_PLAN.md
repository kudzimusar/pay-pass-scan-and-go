1. **User Service** - User profiles, authentication, KYC
2. **Wallet Service** - Balance management, wallet operations
3. **Payment Service** - Domestic payment processing
4. **Cross-Border Service** - International payments, currency exchange
5. **Mobile Money Service** - EcoCash, TeleCash, OneMoney integration
6. **Bank Service** - Traditional banking integrations
7. **Fraud Service** - AI-powered fraud detection and risk assessment
8. **Notification Service** - Real-time notifications across channels
9. **Analytics Service** - Data processing and reporting
10. **Compliance Service** - AML/KYC, regulatory reporting
11. **Gateway Service** - API gateway and routing

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 3.1: Service Extraction (Weeks 1-4)
**Priority: High-impact, low-risk services first**

#### Week 1-2: Notification Service
- **Rationale**: Loosely coupled, high volume, clear boundaries
- **Dependencies**: User Service (for user data)
- **Database**: Separate notification database
- **Communication**: Event-driven (message queue)

#### Week 3-4: Analytics Service
- **Rationale**: Read-only, can work with replicated data
- **Dependencies**: All services (read-only data access)
- **Database**: Separate analytics database with data pipeline
- **Communication**: Event sourcing, batch processing

### Phase 3.2: Core Services (Weeks 5-8)
**Priority: Business-critical services**

#### Week 5-6: User Service
- **Rationale**: Foundation service needed by all others
- **Responsibilities**: Authentication, user profiles, KYC
- **Database**: User and identity data
- **APIs**: REST for CRUD, GraphQL for complex queries

#### Week 7-8: Wallet Service
- **Rationale**: Clear financial boundaries, transaction consistency
- **Responsibilities**: Balance management, wallet operations
- **Database**: Wallet and balance data
- **Consistency**: SAGA pattern for distributed transactions

### Phase 3.3: Payment Services (Weeks 9-12)
**Priority: Core business functionality**

#### Week 9-10: Payment Service
- **Rationale**: High transaction volume, needs scaling
- **Responsibilities**: Domestic payments, QR payments
- **Database**: Transaction data
- **Patterns**: CQRS, Event Sourcing

#### Week 11-12: Cross-Border Service
- **Rationale**: Complex business logic, regulatory requirements
- **Responsibilities**: International payments, currency exchange
- **Database**: Cross-border transaction data
- **Integration**: External currency and banking APIs

### Phase 3.4: Integration Services (Weeks 13-16)
**Priority: External integrations**

#### Week 13-14: Mobile Money Service
- **Rationale**: External provider integrations
- **Responsibilities**: EcoCash, TeleCash, OneMoney
- **Database**: Mobile money transaction data
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms

#### Week 15-16: Bank Service & Fraud Service
- **Rationale**: Specialized capabilities
- **Responsibilities**: Banking integrations, AI fraud detection
- **Database**: Banking data, fraud models
- **Scaling**: ML model serving, high-throughput processing

## Technical Architecture

### Service Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous Communication
```typescript
// REST APIs for real-time operations
interface UserServiceAPI {
  getUser(id: string): Promise<User>;
  updateUser(id: string, data: UpdateUserRequest): Promise<User>;
  verifyKYC(id: string, documents: KYCDocuments): Promise<KYCResult>;
}

// GraphQL for complex queries
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  wallet(userId: ID!): Wallet
  transactions(userId: ID!, limit: Int): [Transaction]
}
```

#### Asynchronous Communication
```typescript
// Event-driven patterns
interface PaymentEvents {
  PaymentInitiated: {
    paymentId: string;
    userId: string;
    amount: number;
    currency: string;
    timestamp: Date;
  };
  
  PaymentCompleted: {
    paymentId: string;
    status: 'success' | 'failed';
    fees: number;
    timestamp: Date;
  };
  
  FraudDetected: {
    transactionId: string;
    riskScore: number;
    riskLevel: 'high' | 'critical';
    blockedAt: Date;
  };
}
```

### Data Management Strategy

#### Database per Service
- **User Service**: PostgreSQL (user data, profiles, KYC)
- **Wallet Service**: PostgreSQL (balances, wallet operations)
- **Payment Service**: PostgreSQL + Redis (transactions, caching)
- **Cross-Border Service**: PostgreSQL (international payments)
- **Analytics Service**: ClickHouse (time-series analytics)
- **Notification Service**: MongoDB (notification templates, delivery logs)

#### Data Consistency Patterns
```typescript
// SAGA Pattern for distributed transactions
class CrossBorderPaymentSaga {
  async execute(payment: CrossBorderPayment) {
    try {
      // Step 1: Reserve funds in wallet
      await this.walletService.reserveFunds(payment.senderId, payment.amount);
      
      // Step 2: Perform fraud check
      const fraudResult = await this.fraudService.assessRisk(payment);
      if (fraudResult.recommendation === 'block') {
        throw new Error('Payment blocked by fraud detection');
      }
      
      // Step 3: Process with bank
      const bankResult = await this.bankService.processPayment(payment);
      
      // Step 4: Update balances
      await this.walletService.commitTransaction(payment.id);
      
      // Step 5: Send notifications
      await this.notificationService.sendPaymentSuccess(payment);
      
    } catch (error) {
      // Compensate on failure
      await this.compensate(payment);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  
  private async compensate(payment: CrossBorderPayment) {
    await this.walletService.releaseReservation(payment.senderId, payment.amount);
    await this.notificationService.sendPaymentFailure(payment);
  }
}
```

### Service Discovery and Configuration

#### Service Registry
```yaml
# service-registry.yml
services:
  user-service:
    instances:
      - host: user-service-1.internal
        port: 8001
      - host: user-service-2.internal
        port: 8001
    health: /health
    tags: [user, authentication]
    
  payment-service:
    instances:
      - host: payment-service-1.internal
        port: 8002
      - host: payment-service-2.internal
        port: 8002
    health: /health
    tags: [payment, transactions]
```

#### Configuration Management
```typescript
// centralized configuration
interface ServiceConfig {
  database: DatabaseConfig;
  redis: RedisConfig;
  messageQueue: MessageQueueConfig;
  externalAPIs: ExternalAPIConfig;
  security: SecurityConfig;
}

class ConfigurationManager {
  async getConfig(serviceName: string): Promise<ServiceConfig> {
    // Fetch from configuration service (Consul, etcd, etc.)
  }
}
```

## Infrastructure & Deployment

### Container Strategy
```dockerfile
# Base service container
FROM node:18-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM base AS service
COPY dist/ .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

### Orchestration (Kubernetes)
```yaml
# user-service deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: paypass/user-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: user-db-secret
              key: url
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

### API Gateway Configuration
```typescript
// API Gateway routing
const routes = {
  '/api/users/*': 'user-service',
  '/api/wallets/*': 'wallet-service',
  '/api/payments/*': 'payment-service',
  '/api/cross-border/*': 'cross-border-service',
  '/api/mobile-money/*': 'mobile-money-service',
  '/api/notifications/*': 'notification-service',
  '/api/analytics/*': 'analytics-service',
};

// Rate limiting per service
const rateLimits = {
  'user-service': { requests: 1000, window: '1m' },
  'payment-service': { requests: 500, window: '1m' },
  'fraud-service': { requests: 2000, window: '1m' },
};
```

class PaymentController {
  async processPayment(request: PaymentRequest) {
    if (this.featureFlags.isEnabled('USE_PAYMENT_SERVICE')) {
      // Route to new microservice
      return this.paymentService.processPayment(request);
    } else {
      // Use existing monolith logic
      return this.legacyPaymentProcessor.process(request);
    }
  }
}
```

}
```

### Distributed Tracing
```typescript
// OpenTelemetry implementation
import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api';

class PaymentService {
  async processPayment(request: PaymentRequest) {
    const span = trace.getActiveSpan();
    span?.setAttributes({
      'payment.amount': request.amount,
      'payment.currency': request.currency,
      'user.id': request.userId,
    });
    
    try {
      const result = await this.executePayment(request);
      span?.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.OK });
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      span?.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR, message: error.message });
